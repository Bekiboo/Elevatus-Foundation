    <h2>How we select our programs&nbsp&nbsp</h2>
    <p>
      Poverty is the root cause of human trafficking. It's a multifaceted
      problem that requires a holistic solution. This is why, since its
      founding, Elevatus has experimented with many different programs to find
      those that would best complement each others. The programs we run today at
      Elevatus are the fruit of more than 10 years of trial and error. <br />
      We still experiment new programs and activities today, and we hope that in
      the years to come, we will be able to propose new and exiting opportunities
      to the children we serve.

            <h4>Food Distribution</h4>
          </div>
          <p>
            According to the World Bank, Madagascar has the fourth highest
            chronic malnutrition rate in the world, with almost half its
            children suffering from hunger. Malnourished children are more
            likely to be sick and to fail at school. If a child is stunted, he
            or she will earn 26 percent less income than average. It has a great
            impact on Madagascar's economy as it estimated that at least 7
            percent of the GDP is lost due to malnutrition. <br />

            Every school day, Elevatus distributes breakfast and lunch to more
            than 100 children from the Ambohidranomanga Junior School and the
            nearby high school as well. Breakfasts are composed of the
            traditional rice soup or corn soup with sugar and powdered milk, and
            lunches vary every day, but are always accompanied with rice.
            Indeed, any Malagasy would tell you that a meal without rice is not
            a meal at all. <br />

            All food is prepared by Solomanampy and Vero, an elderly couple who
            has been working with Elevatus since 2018. After Solomanampy had
            lost his job, the couple had contracted debts they couldn't repay,
            but through their partnership with Elevatus they were able to be
            self-reliant again. <br />

            <h4>School Supplies</h4>
          </div>
          <p>
            Buying school supplies at the beginning of every school years is
            often a struggle in the US for many parents, but in Madagascar it is
            almost impossible for people living in rural areas. To avoid this
            obstacle to learning, Elevatus provides quality school supplies to
            every sponsored students. At the beginning of the school year,
            students receive:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>>Several notebooks</li>
            <li>>Pens and pencils</li>
            <li>>A pencil box</li>
            <li>>A pair of scissors</li>
            <li>>A compas</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            And for those who need, they even get a school bag. At any time of
            the year, students can ask for additional school supplies, so that
            they can learn in the best conditions. Any surplus from this fund
            goes directly towards the school library.

            <h4>Sewing Classes</h4>
          </div>
          The sewing class is our first attempt at teaching a trade skill to the
          students. Since its introduction in 2017, this class has been extremely
          popular among both girls and boys. Those who attend learn the basics of
          sewing with and without a sewing machine. They saw their school uniforms
          and also skirts, small bags, and other simple articles of clothing.<br
          />

          There is no financial participation required from the children -
          Elevatus takes care of everything. We frequently replenish the stock
          of fabric, needles and other sewing supplies. The children take turn
          on the 5 sewing machines while being taught by Felana, who happens to
          also be their math and science tutor.

            <h4>Tutoring Classes</h4>
          </div>
          <p>
            Before we sponsored them, many of the children were out of school
            for several years, often working in rock quarries. To help them and
            the others get back on their feet, Elevatus proposes tutoring
            classes every Wednesday afternoon. Every students are welcome to
            attend, but it is not mandatory. Those classes however became so
            popular that in 2021 we exceeded our class capacity, and we are now
            looking to expand. The tutoring classes focus on Science, Math,
            English and French.

            <h4>School Renovation</h4>
          </div>
          Security is a major concern in rural areas. We believe that a safe haven
          is essential for the good development of children's mind. This is why,
          since 2016, Elevatus regularly undertakes renovation and building projects
          in Ambohidranomanga's schools and in the villages nearby.<br />
          So far we've constructed 4 classrooms, 3 libraries, 3 teacher rooms and
          a refectory. We also renovated 4 classrooms in a centennial school and
          added 2 basketball courts and a volleyball court. <br />
          Our goal is to one day have our own community center where children of
          all ages can come and have a range of wholesome activities.

          </div>
          <p>
            In rural areas of Madagascar, there is not much to do for fun
            besides playing soccer. This is why we started proposing
            extracurricular activites to the children. It is extremely important
            for children and teenagers to explore and try different hobbies. It
            is also an excellent way for them to <br />
            At least once a month we try something new and exiting with the children,
            and it also allows us to get feedback from them so that later we can
            make some of these activities a fully fledged program. For example, if
            our dance classes get more and more enthousiasts, it might turn into
            a weekly program.
